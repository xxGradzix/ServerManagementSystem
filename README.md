Will allow future implementation of in-app purchases and an online shop for server-related products.
### WebSocket Communication with Minecraft Plugin:

Establishes real-time communication between the app and a Minecraft server plugin.
Will allow administrators to monitor and control server activities directly from the management interface.

Planned implementation of an online store within the application, offering various products and services tailored to Minecraft server administration.
